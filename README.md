Hey Guys!

If anyone is looking for a full demoable project for your sem project or want to build something useful on top of an existing project, you can use this Project. I've developed Event Manager using Angular2 Framework. This would save you time instead of building every single thing from scratch. I've tried to ride suitable commit messages on my commits thinking someone can take help from it. For more query you can email me: sigdelsanjog@gmail.com. So that we can discuss more about the project.
